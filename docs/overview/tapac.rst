TAPA Compiler
=============

The task of ``tapa`` is to compile a translation unit of a subset of C++ to a
set of Verilog files.
The translation unit MUST have a top-level task,
which corresponds to the top-level module in the generated Verilog files.

TAPA Tasks
----------

There are two types of tasks: lower-level tasks and upper-level tasks.
The top-level task is just a special task marked as the entry point to the tasks.

Read-only scalars, ``tapa::istream``, ``tapa::ostream``,
and ``tapa::mmap`` are allowed as the formal parameters of tasks.
Tasks cannot have return values.

Lower-Level Task
----------------

A lower-level task cannot instantiate ``tapa::stream``\s or other tasks.
It can own the ``tapa::mmap``\s and read from / write to ``tapa::stream``\s.

Upper-Level Task
----------------

An upper-level task cannot instantiate anything other than ``tapa::stream`` and
children tasks.
It can forward scalars, ``tapa::mmap``\s, ``tapa::istream``\s,
and ``tapa::ostream``\s to children tasks.
An upper-level task can also instantiate new ``tapa::stream``\s.

A scalar or a ``tapa::mmap`` can be forwarded to multiple children tasks.
A ``tapa::istream`` or a ``tapa::ostream`` MUST be forwarded to one and one only
one child task.

Compilation Flow
----------------

1. Obtain the list of tasks from the top-level task.
2. Do source-to-source transformation to obtain the HLS code for each task.
3. Send transformed tasks to HLS and obtain the Verilog files.
4. Modify the Verilog files generated for upper-level tasks to connect to the
   lower-level tasks.
